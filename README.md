___
Automatically detect Medium articles (including subdomains and custom domains) and replace the URL with scribe.rip to unlock Medium articles.
___
## Install
First you need to install a user script manager, depending on the browser you are currently using, [select a user script manager](https://greasyfork.org/en).

Click on the [Medium Unlocked](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/457837-medium%E8%A7%A3%E9%94%81) page to install it, or copy the entire contents of main.js to add the script manually.
## Usage
Click on the green hoverball that appears on the article page, if this ball does not appear please check if your script has been installed correctly
## How the plugin works
[scribe.rip](https://scribe.rip)

Determine whether the current page is a Medium article, replace the URL according to the scheme provided by [scribe.rip](https://scribe.rip), and get the full text by visiting [scribe.rip](https://scribe.rip).

The automated replacement method suggested by [scribe.rip](https://scribe.rip) is [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.codeberg.page/), but the actual experience of using it is not very good.
